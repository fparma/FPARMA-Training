# FP_Training
A repository of the mission file(s) which we will utilize to attempt to enact training and improvement at FPArma.

**DESIGN OUTLINE**<br/>
• *USE ONLY AND ONLY ARMA3+APEX+ACE3 CONTENT - DLC IS PERMITTED IF NOT ESSENTIAL*<br/>
• Every component of the training should be described and depicted within the mission(s). <br/>
• Preferably, Malden's Training Island should be the only location encompassing the training environment. <br/>


**TODO**<br/>
• Upgrade to latest version of FP Template V2/Template 5.0 when its released.<br/>
• Implement a teleporter, if possible.<br/>
• Finish drawing and writing on-site guides.<br/>
• Add more courses to the Anti-Shock training facility<br/>
• Reduce the amount of objects and optimize the environment?<br/>
• Revamp the firing range to allow different weapon types and ammunition to be used without "compromising" the environment.<br/>
• Figure out a way to stock people with ammunition in live fire courses(Marksman training, AT training et al)<br/>
• Figure out a way to respawn targets<br/>
